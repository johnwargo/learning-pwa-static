**If this is a book about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) why isn't this site a PWA?**

This site is not a PWA because it doesn’t need to be a PWA. It’s just a marketing landing page for the book and there are no browser notifications I want to send to visitors nor is there a need to cache the site’s content for increased performance or offline use. Just because I can make the site into a PWA doesn’t mean that I should. Use the power of PWAs only for those sites that really need them.
