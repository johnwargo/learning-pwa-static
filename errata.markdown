## Chapter 8

On page 191, I reference a simplified version of the tip calculator app I have hosted at [Netlify](https://netlify.com). In the book, I list the app URL as https://tip-calc-test.netlify.com/, but after the book went to press, Netlify announced that any hosted app that doesn't have a custom domain associated with it will use netlify.app. Going forward, the URL for the test app is [https://tip-calc-test.netlify.app/](https://tip-calc-test.netlify.app/).
