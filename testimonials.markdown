> You have made an excellent decision in picking up this book. If I was just starting on my learning path to mastery of Progressive Web Apps, there are not many folks I would trust more than John to get me there. I only wish that you could hear John’s voice while you are reading this book like  I did.

> Great stuff! I love the emphasis on doing things without a library/framework, then slowly adding in things like workbox later on.

> I just got your book and am on page two: "I think Google’s description is off base,..." OK, I had to stop and figure out how to email you. This is just the book I wanted after reading so much vague and  misleading information about PWAs online.  No React layer and no fluff about creating a great UI/UX. PWAs just offer a particular way to combine and use manifest files and service workers and you offer a path to understand it all from the component level.
