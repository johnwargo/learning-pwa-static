While testing a new [PWA](https://busystatus.com) controller app I'm creating for a [hardware project](https://github.com/johnwargo/particle-remote-notify-rgb) I'm working on, I noticed a new PWA-related UI feature in the [Chromium Edge browser](https://www.microsoft.com/edge).

If you have a PWA installed, but then navigate to the PWA's public URL, the browser adds a button to the Address Bar enabling you to open the locally installed version of the app instead as shown in the following figure.
