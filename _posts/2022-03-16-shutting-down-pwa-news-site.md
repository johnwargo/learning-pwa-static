The book has been available for purchase now for almost two years and, as I mentioned in the book, I would eventually shutdown the public PWA News site I made available to readers so they could see the full site in action as they worked through the related chapters. I've been paying [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) $10 US a month to host the docker container the site runs in and its time to stop.

At the same time, Microsoft is about to make a change to the Bing APIs the app uses to find PWA articles on the web, so the existing site won't operate after Microsft makes that change in 2022. You can continue to run the code in your local development environment but if you take into account the changed code described in the instructions found in [Updated Server Code for Chapters 3 through 5](https://learningpwa.com/errata/).
